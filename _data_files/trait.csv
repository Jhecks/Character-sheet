A supposed eyewitness account from a local fisherman seemed to be enough to seal the case, but the accused had enough alibis that sentencing wasn’t immediate. Someone confronted the fisherman and discovered he was intimidated into providing false witness and forced into planting the murder weapon by the actual murderer—a local crimelord. His thugs killed the fisherman before he could recant his testimony.

A domain-using PC can gain access to one of these subdomains via this trait. An NPC does not need such a trait, provided that the NPC has a flavorful background that explains how he or she came in contact with the apocryphal information. Benefit(s) : Your religious studies hinged on teachings rarely recognized by your faith. You can select one of the apocryphal subdomains detailed below, provided the subdomain is associated with your patron deity. In some cases, you can select a subdomain associated with a deity despite that deity not offering the associated domain—these exceptions are noted with an asterisk (*), and you gain domain powers and domain spells from the associated domain as usual, even though your deity normally doesn’t grant access to that domain. When selecting a subdomain associated with two domains, a priest can choose only a subdomain that modifies a domain to which he has access. <a name=""TOC-Apocryphal-Subdomains""></a>Apocryphal Subdomains <ul> <li>Captivation</li> <li>Hubris</li> <li>Insect</li> <li>Legend</li> <li>Lightning</li> <li>Medicine</li> <li>Monsoon</li> <li>Petrification</li> <li>Portal</li> <li>Rites</li> <li>Self-Realization</li> <li>Thirst</li> <li>Thorns</li> <li>Truth</li> </ul>",DVA,Acolyte of Apocrypha,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/faith-traits/acolyte-of-apocrypha-faith/
