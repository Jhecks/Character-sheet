A sapling rod produces 2d4 pieces of fruit. A creature that consumes an entire piece of fruit gains the benefits of either a cure moderate wounds or lesser restoration spell (recipient\u2019s choice). Consuming a piece of fruit from a sapling rod is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and no single creature can benefit from more than two piece of fruit from a single blooming. A sapling rod can bloom once per week and after doing so reverts to its original state after all the fruit is picked, or after 24 hours, whichever comes first. Fruit harvested from the tree lasts for 24 hours before shriveling into useless husks."}, {"type": "Wondorous item", "name": "Rod of the Alicorn", "location": "Slotless", "quantity": "1", "weight": "5", "notes": "This twisted wooden rod resembles the horn of a unicorn.\n\nThree times per day, the user can touch the rod to a target as a standard action and heal it with cure light wounds.

Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and \u00d73 on a critical hit instead of the usual \u00d72).\n\nThe Blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the Blade vigorously above his head while speaking a command word. The sun Blade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that acts like bright light and affects creatures susceptible to light as if it were natural sunlight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging the sword, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun Blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the sword is wielded.\n\n\u041a\u0430\u0439\u0440\u0438, \u0444\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f\u0440-\u0441\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0439."}
