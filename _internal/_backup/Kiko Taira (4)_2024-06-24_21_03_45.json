As a swift action, the samurai chooses one target within sight to challenge. The samuraiâs melee attacks deal extra damage when made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is equal to the samuraiâs level. The samurai can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.\n\nChallenging a foe requires much of the samuraiâs concentration. The samurai takes a â2 penalty to his Armor Class, except against attacks made by the target of his challenge.\n\nThe challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious, or until the combat ends. Each samuraiâs challenge also includes another effect, which is listed in the section describing the samuraiâs order.\n\nThe warrior poet adds her samurai level to her damage rolls only on her first successful attack against a challenged target each round."},{"name":"Order (Ronin)","type":"Ex","notes":"At 1st level, a samurai must pledge himself to a specific order, typically the order of the warrior. The order grants the samurai a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts the samurai must follow. If he violates these edicts, he loses the benefits of his orderâs challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.\n\nMost samurai belong to the order of the warrior and are dedicated to their lord. Those without a lord, or who chose to abandon their lord, are ronin. A samurai may instead elect to dedicate himself to one of the orders listed under the cavalier description, but such samurai are rare.\n\nA samurai who wishes to change his order must undertake a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once he has accomplished this, he gains all the bonuses from his new order. The only exception to this is when a samurai decides to become a ronin. A samurai can elect to become a ronin immediately, losing all the benefits from his old Classes order and replacing them with the new benefits from the ronin order. Once a ronin, however, the only way for the samurai to change to another order is through the method described above. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GMâs preference.\n\nThe following orders can be chosen by both cavaliers and samurai."},{"name":"Resolve","type":"Ex","notes":"Starting at 1st level, the samurai gains resolve that he can call upon to endure even the most devastating wounds and afflictions. He can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every two samurai levels beyond 1st. Whenever the samurai defeats the target of his challenge, he regains one daily use of his resolve, up to his maximum number of uses per day. Defeating the target of his challenge usually involves reducing the target to 0 hit points or fewer, but the GM might rule that an enemy who surrenders or flees the battle is also defeated. He can use this resolve in a number of ways.\n\nDetermined: As a standard action, the samurai can spend one use of his resolve to remove the fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition. If the samurai is at least 8th level, he can alternatively remove the exhausted, frightened, nauseated, or staggered condition. If the condition has a duration longer than 1 hour or is permanent, this ability removes the condition for 1 hour, at which time the condition returns.\n\nResolute: Whenever the samurai is required to make a Fortitude or Will save, he can spend one use of his resolve as an immediate action to roll twice and take the better result. He must decide to use this ability before he rolls the saving throw.\n\nUnstoppable: When the samurai is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points but not slain, he can spend one use of his resolve as an immediate action to instantly stabilize and remain conscious. He is staggered, but he does not fall unconscious and begin dying if he takes a standard action. He does fall unconscious if he takes additional damage from any source."},{"name":"Dancer's grace","type":"Ex","notes":"When wearing light or no armor and not using a shield, the warrior poet gains a bonus to Armor Class equal to her Charisma bonus (to a maximum of her samurai level).

At 1st level, the warrior poet gains a flourish of her choice from the list below. She gains another flourish at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, 17th, and 20th levels.\n\nChrysanthemumâs Blooming: The warrior poet gains Vital Strike as a bonus feat and can apply its benefit when using Spring Attack. If the warrior poet is at least 16th level and has Improved Vital Strike, she can apply that featâs benefit instead. The warrior poet must be at least 11th level to select this flourish.\n\nExodus of Speed: As long as the warrior poet is wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load, her land speed increases by 10 feet. A warrior poet can select this flourish up to three times.\n\nHarmony of the Tranquil Garden: The warrior poet can focus her senses as a move action to gain blindsense out to 5 feet for 1 round. For every 5 samurai levels she has, the range of this blindsense increases by 5 feet.\n\nUncanny Guidance: The warrior poet gains the rogueâs uncanny dodge class feature. This flourish can be selected up to twice; selecting it a second time grants the warrior poet the rogueâs improved uncanny dodge class feature. The warrior poet must be at least 4th level to select this flourish the first time and at least 8th level to select this flourish the second time.\n\nKitsuneâs Mystique: The warrior poet gains Improved Feint as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. When the warrior poet uses Spring Attack or takes a move action to move, she can attempt to feint against one creature she threatens during her movement as part of her movement.\n\nPetals on the Wind: Whenever a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the warrior poet, she can move 5 feet before making the attack of opportunity. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
